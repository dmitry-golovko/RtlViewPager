# RtlViewPager with TabLayout support
ViewPager that displays items from right to left for RTL locales and behaves like a regular ViewPager otherwise

Usage
-------------
To use it - just copy `PagerAdapterWrapper` and `RtlViewPager` classes into your project.

In XML:

    <klogi.com.viewpagerwithdifferentmenu.RtlViewPager
        android:id="@+id/viewPager"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
  
In code:

    TabLayout tabLayout = (TabLayout)findViewById(R.id.tabLayout);
    RtlViewPager viewPager = (RtlViewPager)findViewById(R.id.viewPager);
    viewPager.setAdapter(new PagerAdapter(getSupportFragmentManager(), fragments));
    tabLayout.setupWithViewPager(viewPager);      
  


Acknowledgment

This module was originally developed for Booking.com. With approval from Booking.com, this module was generalized and published on GitHub and jCenter. From my side, I did one important bugfix to enable TabLayout.
